Language: Javascript, HTML, CSS

Library: p5.js

A prototype was also made using Python. The goal was to understand the fundamentals of how a double pendulum moves and basic animation in a language I am more familiar with.
I used matplotlib, numpy, sympy, and scipy for this version. 

This program is a double pendulum simulator with goals of giving a visual of chaos theory. When working with chaotic systems, such as double pendulums,
a small, almost negligible, change in initial values can drastically impact future pathways.

This was my first program using primarily JS and I had the opportunity to improve my OOP. I was also introduced to Lagrangian Mechanics when learning
how to calculate the movements of a double pendulum.
